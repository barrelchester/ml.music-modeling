CS 6140 Machine Learning Final Project

The classification of music into genres is a challenging problem in machine learning. It is relevant not only in the research realm, but also in the music technology industry as a way to distribute music to users. In our project, we explore previous work in this field and design binary and multi-class models to classify music in a new dataset containing 79,335 songs downloaded from MySpace via Internet Archive into 32 mapped genres. Additionally, we explore the representation of songs as vectors over which similarity calculations can be made to find song recommendations.

## Instructions
### All completed notebooks can be found in the app folder. 

Each notebook has its own instructions for running. The paths in each notebook can be changed to load in the data.

### Data

Data is saved in a private OneDrive group. Group members, professors, and TAs have been added to this folder.

The models trained in this project use data from the **"myspace_mp3s"** folder. Note that this folder has arbitrary subfolders grouping together songs for uploading purposes. 

The mfcc featuers generated from these myspace mp3 songs are saved in the **audio_features** folder. 

Within the **"myspace_mp3s"** folder is the **metadata.json.gz** (metadata for these song files) and **genre_map.pkl** (our mapped genres). 

The paths in each noteobok can be changed to load in the data used via the folders listed above.
